## MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
Multiple linear regression is a way to predict the value of one variable based on the values of two or more other variables. Think of it like finding the best-fit line in a multi-dimensional space, where we can see how multiple factors (variables) affect something we're trying to measure.
``` python
Example: Predicting House Prices

Scenario: A real estate company wants to predict the selling price of houses in a neighborhood.

Independent Variables: The company collects data on various features of the houses, such as:

Square footage
1. Number of bedrooms
2. Number of bathrooms
3. Age of the house
4. Proximity to schools and parks
5. Neighborhood crime rate
6. Dependent Variable: The selling price of the house.

Relevance: 

By using multiple linear regression, the company can analyze how each of these independent variables affects the price of a house. For instance, they might find that houses with more bedrooms and larger square footage tend to sell for higher prices.
This model allows the company to make informed predictions about the price of a house based on its features, helping both sellers and buyers in the real estate market.
Connection to the Content:
This example demonstrates how having multiple relevant features (independent variables) can lead to a more accurate prediction of the dependent variable (house price). Just like in the car pricing example from the content, including various features helps create a more robust model.

### Concept

In multiple linear regression, we have:
- **Dependent Variable (Outcome)**: The thing we are trying to predict. 
- **Independent Variables (Predictors)**: The factors we believe might affect the dependent variable.

For example, if we wanted to predict a student’s **test score** based on how many hours they studied and how much sleep they got, we’d use multiple linear regression. Here:
- **Test score** is the dependent variable (what we want to predict).
- **Hours of study** and **hours of sleep** are the independent variables.

### Real-World Example

Imagine we surveyed a group of students and collected data on their study hours, sleep hours, and test scores. We want to understand if studying and sleep can help us predict test scores.

Here’s a sample dataset:

```python
| Student| Hours Studied (X1) | Hours Slept (X2) | Test Score (Y) |
|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Student 1   | 5                       | 8                     | 85                  |
| Student 2   | 6                       | 7                     | 88                  |
| Student 3   | 7                       | 6                     | 90                  |
| Student 4   | 8                       | 7                     | 92                  |
| Student 5   | 4                       | 9                     | 80                  |
```
In this example:
- **X1 (Hours Studied)** and **X2 (Hours Slept)** are our independent variables.
- **Y (Test Score)** is the dependent variable.

### Multiple Linear Regression Formula

The formula for multiple linear regression looks like this:
\[
Y = b_0 + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2
\]
where:
- \( Y \) is the predicted test score.
- \( b_0 \) is the intercept (a starting value of test score when study and sleep hours are zero).
- \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are coefficients that tell us how much each additional hour of study or sleep affects the test score.

### Interpretation

Once we calculate \( b_0 \), \( b_1 \), and \( b_2 \) (using statistical software or a calculator), we can plug in values for **Hours Studied** and **Hours Slept** to predict a test score. This is useful because it lets us make educated guesses about a student's performance based on their habits!

### Summary

Multiple linear regression helps us predict an outcome based on multiple influencing factors, like understanding how both study time and sleep affect test scores, rather than looking at just one factor.
