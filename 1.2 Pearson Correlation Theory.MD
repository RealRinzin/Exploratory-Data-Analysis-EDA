## PEARSON CORRELATION THEORY

The **Pearson correlation** is a way to measure how strongly two things are related to each other. It helps us understand if an increase in one thing (like height) is related to an increase or decrease in another thing (like weight). The value of the Pearson correlation is a number between -1 and 1:

- **1** means a perfect positive relationship (both things increase or decrease together).
- **-1** means a perfect negative relationship (when one thing increases, the other decreases).
- **0** means no relationship between the two things.

### Example: Comparing Hours of Study and Test Scores

Here’s a table with some data showing the number of hours students studied and their test scores:
``` Python
| Student | Hours of Study | Test Score |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| A       | 1              | 55         |
| B       | 2              | 60         |
| C       | 3              | 65         |
| D       | 4              | 70         |
| E       | 5              | 75         |
```

In this case, as the number of hours of study increases, the test score also increases. This shows a **positive correlation**.

- If we calculate the **Pearson correlation**, it will be close to **1**, indicating a strong positive relationship between hours studied and test scores.

### Example: Comparing Hours of TV Watched and Test Scores

Let’s look at another example where the relationship might not be so straightforward:
``` Python

| Student | Hours of TV Watched | Test Score |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| A       | 1                   | 55         |
| B       | 2                   | 60         |
| C       | 3                   | 50         |
| D       | 4                   | 40         |
| E       | 5                   | 35         |
```

In this case, as the number of hours spent watching TV increases, the test score decreases. This shows a **negative correlation**.

- If we calculate the **Pearson correlation** for this data, it will be close to **-1**, indicating a strong negative relationship.

### How to Interpret the Pearson Correlation:

- A **positive** correlation (close to +1) means that as one variable increases, the other also increases.
- A **negative** correlation (close to -1) means that as one variable increases, the other decreases.
- A **zero** or near-zero correlation means there is no relationship between the two variables.

In real life, Pearson correlation can be used for many things, like:
- Predicting someone’s weight based on their height.
- Checking if studying more leads to better grades.
- Analyzing if people who watch more TV tend to do worse in school.

# Examples for each Range
Sure! Here are **real-life examples** for each range of Pearson correlation, using situations students or adults might encounter in everyday life.

### 1. **Perfect Positive Correlation (r = 1)**

   **Example**: **The number of seconds in a minute** and **the number of minutes in an hour**.

   - **Explanation**: This is a perfect correlation because every time you multiply the number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (60), you will always get the same result, which is 3600 seconds. There's a perfect relationship between these two.
```python
| Measurement | Seconds | Minutes |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| 1 minute    | 60      | 1       |
| 2 minutes   | 120     | 2       |
| 3 minutes   | 180     | 3       |
| 4 minutes   | 240     | 4       |
| 5 minutes   | 300     | 5       |
```
- **Pearson correlation**: **1** (perfect positive correlation, as one unit increases, the other increases in perfect proportion).

---

### 2. **Strong Positive Correlation (r = 0.8 to 1)**

   **Example**: **Amount of exercise** and **general fitness level**.

   - **Explanation**: People who exercise more regularly tend to have better fitness levels, although the relationship is not perfectly proportional (other factors like diet or genetics can play a role).
```python

| Person | Hours of Exercise per Week | Fitness Level (Scale 1-10) |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| A      | 1                          | 4                         |
| B      | 2                          | 5                         |
| C      | 3                          | 6                         |
| D      | 4                          | 7                         |
| E      | 5                          | 9                         |

- **Pearson correlation**: **0.9** (strong positive correlation, more exercise generally leads to better fitness).
```
---

### 3. **No Correlation (r = 0)**

   **Example**: **Favorite ice cream flavor** and **height**.

   - **Explanation**: There is no meaningful relationship between someone’s favorite ice cream flavor and their height. Some tall people may like chocolate, and some short people may like vanilla, but there’s no predictable pattern.
```python

| Person | Favorite Ice Cream Flavor | Height (in cm) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------|
| A      | Chocolate                 | 170            |
| B      | Vanilla                   | 160            |
| C      | Strawberry                | 180            |
| D      | Chocolate                 | 175            |
| E      | Mint                      | 165            |
```
- **Pearson correlation**: **0** (no correlation, the flavor choice has no relationship with height).

---

### 4. **Weak Negative Correlation (r = -0.2 to -0.5)**

   **Example**: **Number of hours spent on social media** and **grades in school**.

   - **Explanation**: There may be a weak negative correlation because, in general, students who spend more time on social media tend to spend less time on studying, leading to lower grades. However, the effect isn't dramatic for everyone, as some students can manage both well.
```python

| Student | Hours on Social Media | Test Score |
|---------|-----------------------|------------|
| A       | 1                     | 90         |
| B       | 2                     | 85         |
| C       | 3                     | 78         |
| D       | 4                     | 70         |
| E       | 5                     | 65         |
```
- **Pearson correlation**: **-0.4** (weak negative correlation, more social media use tends to reduce test scores, but it's not a strong relationship).

---

### 5. **Strong Negative Correlation (r = -0.8 to -1)**

   **Example**: **Amount of junk food consumed** and **health (e.g., cholesterol level)**.

   - **Explanation**: People who consume a lot of junk food tend to have higher cholesterol, and a strong negative relationship exists: the more junk food they eat, the worse their health gets, especially concerning heart disease risk factors like cholesterol levels.
```python

| Person | Junk Food (Hours per Week) | Cholesterol Level (mg/dL) |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| A      | 1                          | 150                       |
| B      | 2                          | 160                       |
| C      | 3                          | 180                       |
| D      | 4                          | 200                       |
| E      | 5                          | 220                       |
```
- **Pearson correlation**: **-0.9** (strong negative correlation, the more junk food consumed, the higher the cholesterol level).

---

### 6. **Perfect Negative Correlation (r = -1)**

   **Example**: **Distance from home** and **time taken to reach home** (when speed is constant).

   - **Explanation**: There’s a perfect negative relationship between how far you are from home and how long it takes to get there—if you know the speed, the more distance, the longer the time, in exact proportion.
```python

| Distance from Home (km) | Time to Reach Home (hours) |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1                       | 0.5                        |
| 2                       | 1                          |
| 3                       | 1.5                        |
| 4                       | 2                          |
| 5                       | 2.5                        |
```
- **Pearson correlation**: **-1** (perfect negative correlation, as the distance increases, the time increases in direct proportion).

---

### Summary of Real-Life Examples:
- **r = 1**: **Seconds in a minute** and **Minutes in an hour** (perfect positive correlation).
- **0.8 to 1**: **Exercise time** and **fitness level** (strong positive correlation).
- **r = 0**: **Favorite ice cream flavor** and **height** (no correlation).
- **-0.2 to -0.5**: **Social media time** and **test scores** (weak negative correlation).
- **-0.8 to -1**: **Junk food consumption** and **cholesterol levels** (strong negative correlation).
- **r = -1**: **Distance from home** and **time to reach home** (perfect negative correlation).

Each example is based on realistic scenarios where correlation can be used to see how two variables relate to each other!
