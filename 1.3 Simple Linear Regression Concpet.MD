## 1. SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

**Simple Linear Regression** is a statistical method used to understand the relationship between two variables. One variable is the **independent variable** (the one you manipulate or control), and the other is the **dependent variable** (the one that responds to changes in the independent variable). The goal is to find a straight line that best fits the data points, which can then be used to make predictions.

### Key Points:
- **Independent variable (X)**: The input or cause.
- **Dependent variable (Y)**: The output or effect.
- **Equation of the line**: 

  \[Y = mX + b\]

  - **m** is the slope of the line (how much Y changes for each unit change in X).
  - **b** is the y-intercept (the value of Y when X = 0).

### Example: Predicting a Student’s Test Score

Let’s say you want to predict a student's test score based on how many hours they studied. Here’s some sample data:
``` python
| Hours Studied (X) | Test Score (Y) |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 1                 | 50             |
| 2                 | 55             |
| 3                 | 60             |
| 4                 | 65             |
| 5                 | 70             |
```

In this case:
- **X** is the number of hours studied.
- **Y** is the test score.

We can use simple linear regression to find the line that best fits this data. The line could look like this: 

\[
Y = 5X + 45
\]

### What does this equation mean?
- **Slope (m) = 5**: For every hour a student studies, their score increases by 5 points.
- **Intercept (b) = 45**: If a student studied 0 hours, their predicted score would be 45.

### Prediction:
If a student studies for 6 hours, we can predict their score:
\[
Y = 5(6) + 45 = 30 + 45 = 75
\]

So, the student would likely score 75 on the test.

This is a basic example of how simple linear regression helps us understand and predict relationships between two variables!
